## Features Implemented
We chose 3 of our 6 features to implement in this assignment, and they are as follows:
1. Administrators shall be able to create a prescription order for a client.
2. Administrators shall be able to view and update the status of a clientâ€™s prescription.
3. Administrators shall be able to search their inventory for detailed information about a particular drug, namely its identifiers, quantity in stock, dosage instructions, ingredients, and side effects.
    
    **Note:** We did not implement the associated drug specific information page that is loaded when a drug entry is clicked on, however search functionality remains intact.
